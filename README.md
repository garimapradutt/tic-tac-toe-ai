# Tic-Tac-Toe AI ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–

This project implements a fully playable **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with a **Pygame-based interface** and an **AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm**. The AI plays optimally, ensuring either a win or a tie against the human player.  

## Features
- Interactive **Pygame GUI** for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.  
- Choose to play as **X** or **O**.  
- AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** for optimal moves.  
- Clear game state display: current player, winner, or tie.  
- Option to **restart the game ("Play Again")** after completion.  
- Clean separation of **game logic** (`tictactoe.py`) and **game interface** (`runner.py`).
